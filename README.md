# 📘 Coding Practice

This repository contains topic-wise coding problems solved by me.

Currently, I am preparing for an upcoming exam and creating a focused **5-Day Coding Sheet**.  
The goal is to solve selected problems and revise them before the exam.

Although I have solved many problems earlier, this structured sheet helps in:
- Quick revision
- Strengthening core concepts
- Improving speed and accuracy
- Identifying weak areas
